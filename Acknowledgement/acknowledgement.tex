  Before you lies the graduation report that displays all the accomplishments and research conducted during the final phase of my Bachelor Software Engineering study at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, written to fulfill the graduation requirements. The moment I was introduced to my assignment reminded me of a chapter in a book called Clean Code, in which this exact pursuit is used as a common example for which the book would provide solutions; â€œNow the two teams are in a race. The tiger team must build a new system that does everything that the old system does. Not only that, they have to keep up with the changes that are continuously being made to the old system. Management will not replace the old system until the new system can do everything that the old system does."~\citep{CleanCode}. This challenge, I could not have accomplished without the help of my colleques, therefore I would like to thank Dan Stefancu, Marco Strijker and Martin Zwaneveld for their insightful criticism that has led to the most useful lessons during my internship.
