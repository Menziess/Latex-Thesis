% A generic location-based price calculation system be implemented by separating ...

% Which location encoding is sufficient for this system to be operational?
Addresses and postal codes can be translated to geometric datatypes such as Points, Polygons and MultiPolygons. Geometry based locations can be visualized, and thus interpreted regardless of the country in which a location resides. Matching is done through the OpenGIS or GeoJSON API, by writing geospatial queries depending on the selected candidate database system. Selected candidate database systems are systems that adhere to the OpenGIS or GeoJSON standard, yielding many possibilities, of which MySQL and MongoDB have been proven to be workable. The problem of overlapping locations, can be solved using complex and straight forward approaches, thus proving this location encoding to be sufficient for this system to be operational.

% What is most fitting solution to integrate the backend and frontend into the existing architecture?
A NodeJS loopback microservice should be implemented along with a MongoDB database, resulting in a scalable high performance solution that can be deployed independently. Introducing a stateless authentication service to implement identity management, allowing the microservice to be more decoupled, bringing the amount of verification requests down to zero. This solution is most fitting to the existing architecture, that only has to implement one future proof authentication method.

% Which logic and data is required in the backend to reliably calculate a trip price?
Locations should only be used as criteria if the relevant location coordinates are provided by the booking app. Timeframes, passenger count, vehicle types, on-meter and estimation options always apply as criteria by which a rule is matched. The original rules are implemented to each have their own classes, producing deterministic higher order functions that calculate the final trip price, using functional programming techniques.

% Is it possible to communicate the inner workings of the system through the user interface?
The sidebar reflects which major concepts exist within the portal: Products, Pricing, Locations, and Apps. Composite views reflect the coherence that exists between related entities, while separation of independent entities reduce the cognitive overhead while reasoning about pricing rules. Spatial grouping on the page hint which properties belong to which entity, for which all human beings have a natural intuition. Manual activation and sorting of rules force the user to actively decide whether a rule should match, which can be tested immediately using the companies' booking app.
