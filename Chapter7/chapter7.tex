\[\textit{How can a generic location-based price calculation system be implemented}\]
\[\textit{that could be used in every country?}\] \hfill

The four challenges manifested in the research questions that constructed this assignment have been answered in order to successfully implement the trip price calculation system. The best possible way of mapping conveyable locations to pricing rules in a system that integrates in the existing system architecture of taxiID, keeping the original rule types while improving the interpretability of the matching logic through the user interface, has been researched. Information available in the public domain has been used to answer empirical questions, from which proposals based on good arguments have been made, and working proof of concepts have been created, out of which some have been implemented, resulting in a system design that could be used for many other purposes in the software industry.

Geometric datatypes such as Points, Polygons, Multipolygons and relevant predicates are supported by the the OpenGIS and GeoJSON specifications, which are capable of replacing the legacy location definitions. Shapes on a map can be interpreted universally, and intersections of geometry based locations are easy to understand. MongoDB and MySQL support these specifications. Overlapping location matches can be limited by user assigned priorities.

The trip pricing system can be integrated as a microservice where the combination of NodeJS and MongoDB provide a scalable and well performing solution. The existing portal can adopt the required views that retrieve Information from the microservice directly. Authentication and authorization is handled by the microservice via JSON Web Tokens, allowing state to be shared in the token payload, allowing the microservice to be decoupled from adjacent systems, avoiding additional verification network requests.

When a passenger books a ride, the provided information that belongs to the ride is required to match departure, destination, timeframe, passenger count, vehicle types and additional settings of the user defined rule for the associated prices to apply. Fixed, dynamic, and threshold prices have been implemented using generated functors with default parameters for deterministic outcomes.

The user is guided through different concepts during the process of constructing a pricing rule, using a Shneiderman's Mantra inspired hierarchy of components. Making use of preattentive attributes to reflect coherence within composite views that contain parts of the pricing rule. Granting responsibility to the user in relation to activating and sorting rules, stimulates the users understanding of the inner workings of the system. The workings that may always be verified by booking a ride in the booking app.
