This chapter describes the process and techniques used while implementing the solution.


\subsection{Methods and Techniques}
Before development could commence, requirements were described as user stories in Jira, a project management tool. The user stories were exported to a backlog, where the tasks were defined more precisely. The product owner prioritised tasks so that the most essential features were developed first.

To produce software that meets the expectations of the product owners, a sprint was planned every two weeks, joined by one of the product owners, and members of the development team that were responsible for the systems architecture, where issues or tasks were well-defined and prioritised.
