% EXAMPLE FROM PREV CHAPTER
% The price calculation system that is being made should integrate in the existing architecture seamlessly. This chapter aims to answer question number two, and its subquestions. First it is determined whether the frontend and backend that are to be developed should be integrated in existing projects, or should be made in separate projects altogether. If the backend is created as a separate project, authentication and authorization are directly affected by these decisions. Separation implies more complex identity management, or less separation of concern. Then, the database should be capable of storing geometry, and accept queries to determine which polygons contain a set of points, and which points are contained within a polygon.


What does a price calculation look like? (How should they be calculated)

A tier price system, that calculates fixed prices based cascading thresholds, and a dynamic pricing system that calculates prices per distance unit and minute is a very specific problem that must be split up into sizable categories to increase the chances of finding relevant solutions. The term 'distance unit' is used on purpose, as distances are measured using different metrics in various countries. Pricing rules should be constrained by time frames, making rules available only for some hours a day, or only on christmas for example. Rules should be specifyable per product as different vehicle types have different prices, but are included in the same pricing rules. Discounts may be calculated with the trip price, and VAT should be displayed in the price breakdown. Some additional requirements to the system may be added in later phases, as Scrum is used to manage work iterations (this fact is covered later in this chapter). The system should be accessible to other systems, meaning that applications that currently rely on the old system should be able to migrate to the new system. As the old system shouldn't be used for new applications, as it was not designed for this use case. The system should have a single responsibility, and should be autonomous in that regard.
