\begin{abstract}
Taxi companies have been delivering booking apps in response to passengers' raising expectations of being presented a list of available cabs with corresponding prices, on demand. YourDriverApp is a new white label application developed by taxiID that is set to provide this solution to taxi companies worldwide. Despite the fact that YourDriverApp is new, it still depends on the price calculation functionality of a legacy system, which was not designed with internationalization in mind. Besides that fact that business information has to be stored in a platform that has no relation with YourDriverApp, the lack of internationalization capabilities poses a problem. Company administrators are obligated to define trip prices for particular postal codes and address combinations. But how would these prices be defined in a country that has no postal code system? The aim of this study is to determine how a generic trip price calculation system can be implemented in a way that is usable by companies located anywhere in the world. Research questions are answered by gathering information available in the public domain, after which the acquired knowledge is translated to proposals and proof of concepts.

A purely geometrical interpretation of user-defined locations allows taxi-companies around the world to set up pricing information in corresponding views that are added to the YourDriverApp portal. Geometry datatypes provide part of the solution of matching pricing rules, but the benefits of geometrical definitions are lost when areas overlap. A hierarchy of priority based rules tied to reusable locations eliminates these competing rule matches. A microservice is created with a single responsibility of calculating trip prices. A JSON Web Token allows user identity to be transferred in the payload of the token, thereby delegating authentication to the core system, safeguarding the single responsibility of the microservice. Functional programming techniques allow deterministic functors to be generated for consistent price calculations, while visual representations of pricing rule criteria allow users to reason about the inner workings of the system, regardless of their nationality.
